# Women Safety using Machine Learning

### Introduction
This project is using Machine Learning to predict whether a given place in a given time is safe for a women to go.
The datasets which we have collected is fed into the machine learning model to predict the outcome.

### Features
The prediction is done based on various features(parameters) including but not limited to
* Place
* Zone
* Time
* People frequency
* Bar availability
* Police Station availability
* Police frequency

### Model
As of now we are trying to predict SAFE/UNSAFE which is **logistic regression**.

### Contribute! 
Any suggestions to improve this will be welcomed.
